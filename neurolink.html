        <p> Electrodes pick up neural activity and AI translates it to cursor movement or typing. Early success in
          paralysis patients controlling computers. Currently research-only; future goal is restoring movement, speech,
          vision.

          <h2>Restoring Ability, Rebuilding Lives</h2>
          <p> At its core, Neuralink’s work focuses on medical transformation. Neurological conditions can take away the
            most basic human functions — movement, speech, independence. Neuralink aims to give them back. By implanting
            tiny, flexible electrodes into the brain, the technology interprets neural activity and translates it into
            digital commands. For individuals living with paralysis, this opens the possibility of controlling
            computers, robotic limbs, or communication systems with pure thought. The goal is simple yet powerful:
            turning imagination into action for those who need it most.

          <h2>A Future of Human-Machine Harmony</h2>
          <p>Beyond medical applications lies a vision of augmented capability. Neuralink represents the possibility of
            accelerating learning, expanding memory, and enabling new levels of creativity and intelligence. It imagines
            a future where technology does not sit outside us — but works with us, enhancing what the human brain can do
            naturally. It’s not just about overcoming limitations; it’s about unlocking the extraordinary potential
            within the human mind. With each breakthrough, Neuralink brings us closer to a world where interaction with
            devices is effortless, intuitive, and driven entirely by intention.

          <p>
            With innovation this powerful comes responsibility. Neuralink operates in one of the most sensitive areas of
            science — the human brain — and recognizes the importance of ethical development, clinical safety, and
            transparent progress. Every milestone is grounded in rigorous testing, medical oversight, and long-term
            vision. The company understands that this technology carries profound societal implications and approaches
            it with the respect and care it deserves.
